# SeamlessFloodMapper: Seamless Flood Mapping Using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 Image Time Series
Earth observation satellites provide data for continuous and extensive flood monitoring, yet limitations exist when using optical images due to cloud cover. Gap-filling methods have been developed for reconstructing cloud-covered areas in water maps. However, the existing methods are not tailored for and validated in cloudy and rainy flooding scenarios with rapid water extent changes and limited clear-sky observations. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel method for seamless time series flood mapping under varying cloud cover conditions.
